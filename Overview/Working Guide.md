This document focuses on guiding the student to excel in his study environment while making full use of resources provided to them to achieve a celebratory score. Below given are the outlines that need to be followed by the student for their desired outcomes:
### Inventory Management
Student's inventory for studying a specific course should involved the following items:
- Syllabus: Helps you get a broader aspect and plan ahead
- Reference books: Helps you write concise and well structured class notes
- Faculty contact details: Helpful for doubt solving and networking
- Class Notes and Assignment Solution Report (ASR): Helpful for in-depth study of the subject to be well prepared before an exam
- Flashcards and Cheat sheets: Helpful for last minute revisions and to quickly get an overview when time is limited
### Workflow
The recommended workflow to stay ahead of the competition and not be overburdened is can be designed such: 
- Document syllabus, reference books and faculty contact details before starting any course
- Create hand written class notes after every lecture and make a structured plan on completion of an assignment. Write fair obsidian notes after lecture. After completing the assignment, or while attempting, a fair copy of the assignment solutions must be maintained which can later be scanned for a soft annotated copy.
- Flashcards and cheat sheets for a particular topic can be made after the topic is fully taught, class notes on the topic are made and ASRs on the topic are completed.
### Selective Note Taking
A common issue is filtering of the class proceedings that need to be noted. It is an important skill that needs to be developed in order to make clear and concise notes. 
Professors make a detailed note on several topics in order to give a clear understanding of the concept. This involves giving various examples of different forms and to elaborate their personal experiences. Here is what to consider:
- **Must note:** Topic and sub-topic names, formulas, definitions and diagrams
- **Not to note:** Examples, solved problems and personal experiences
Note that solved problems should be documented in Assignment Solution Reports (ASRs) and not in class notes.
### Operations Method
Create "operations" which will assign you specific tasks to complete in a fix span (usually less than a day). An operation should contain a title, description and deliverables and withing a period of few hours after initiating an operation, the deliverables should be presented.
### Meditation
Remember to treat studying as a form of meditation and any distraction being a harm to your concentration. Just like meditation, studying enriches your brain and self control power.
