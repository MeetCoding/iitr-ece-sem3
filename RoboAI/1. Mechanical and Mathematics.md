A robot mainly comprises of three components: **Base, Controller and Processor**.
- **Base:** Stable platform that supports the robot's body and movements. It is the starting point for all the robot's calculations and movements.
- **Controller:** Computer system that manages a robot's actions.
- **Processor:** Device that controls movement, sensors and actuators of a robot.
*Example: Arduino is a controller and raspberry pi is a processor*
