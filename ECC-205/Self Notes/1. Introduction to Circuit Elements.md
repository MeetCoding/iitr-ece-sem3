Circuital elements can either be analog or digital. Power management IC, power amplifier, display interface and battery charger come under analog circuits whereas SRAM and processors come under digital circuits.

**Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL):**    
    - The total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving it.
    - At any node: $∑Iin=∑Iout$
**Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL):**    
    - The sum of all voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.
    - For any loop: $∑V=0$

However, KVL is violated when a time varying magnetic field is present around the circuit due to induced electric field.
Suppose we have a loop of current which transfers current from the power supply to the processor and in between the loop we have some circuital elements.
The power supply passes current whenever the processor needs to do some switching action in its internal gates (usually at 4GHz frequency). Due to this constantly varying current, a varying electric field around the central circuit produces a varying magnetic field which disturbs KVL in the internal circuit.
In order to minimize the effect of this irregularity in KVL, we:
- Reduce the size of the loop as much as possible
- Avoid very high frequencies

Let, $\sum V=V_e(f)$ be the equation for the flawed KVL in the internal circuit. Note that the error voltage is a function of the frequency of current switching.
$V_e(f)$ follows an exponential curve with respect to $f$ and $V_e(f)\propto fI(f)$.
$I(f)$ starts from zero at zero frequency and rises to a maximum at $f=f_o$ and then declines further. $B(f)\propto I(f)/R$, so $V_e(f)\propto fB(f)$, while $V_e(t)\propto \dfrac{dB}{dt}$.
