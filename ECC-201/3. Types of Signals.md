## 1. Based on Frequency Content

#### Baseband (Lowpass) Signal
- **Definition:** A signal whose frequency content starts from (or is centered around) zero up to a certain maximum (cutoff) frequency.
- **Examples:** Original audio, video, digital data streams before modulation.
- **Use:** Common in wired communication and as input to modulators for transmission.

#### Bandpass Signal
- **Definition:** A signal with frequency content concentrated in a specific range away from zero, centered around a carrier frequency.    
- **Examples:** AM/FM radio signals, most wireless transmissions.    
- **Use:** Required for wireless and radio communications after modulation.

#### Lowpass Signal
- **Definition:** Sometimes used interchangeably with baseband, but formally refers to signals passed by or existing within a lowpass filter—i.e., frequencies from zero up to a cutoff point.
- **Use:** Common in filtering noise from signals or isolating baseband content.

#### Highpass Signal
- **Definition:** Signal with frequency components that exist only above a certain cutoff frequency.
- **Use:** Used to remove low-frequency noise/hum.

#### Bandstop (Notch) Signal
- **Definition:** Signal intentionally having certain frequency ranges removed or not present (opposite of a bandpass).
- **Use:** Eliminating unwanted interference within a frequency band (e.g., 50Hz mains noise).

## 2. Based on Information Representation

| Type           | Description                                        | Example                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Analog Signal  | Continuous in time and amplitude                   | Voice, music, analog TV      |
| Digital Signal | Discrete in time and amplitude (binary: 0s and 1s) | Computer data, digital audio |

## 3. Based on Time Domain & Sampling

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Continuous-time|Defined for every instant in time|
|Discrete-time|Defined only at specific time intervals|

## 4. Other Mathematical/Physical Classifications
- **Periodic Signal:** Repeats itself after a regular interval (e.g., sine wave).
- **Aperiodic (Non-periodic) Signal:** Does not repeat over time.    
- **Deterministic Signal:** Can be described completely by a mathematical function; future values are predictable.    
- **Random (Stochastic) Signal:** Contains uncertainty, often modeled statistically (e.g., noise signals).    
- **Energy Signal:** Has finite total energy over all time.    
- **Power Signal:** Has finite average power but potentially infinite energy (e.g., continuous sinewaves).
- **Causal/Non-causal:** Causal signals are zero for all times before t=0t=0; non-causal otherwise.

## 5. Communication-Specific Types
- **Single Sideband (SSB):** Only one half (sideband) of a modulated spectrum is transmitted
- **Double Sideband (DSB):** Both sidebands around the carrier are transmitted
- **Narrowband Signal:** Occupies a small bandwidth compared to its center frequency
- **Wideband Signal:** Occupies a large bandwidth relative to its center frequency.
