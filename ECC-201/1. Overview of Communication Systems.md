Typical communication model:
Source $\rightarrow$ Transmitter Txr (Modulation) $\rightarrow$ Channel $\rightarrow$ Receiver Rxr (Demodulation) $\rightarrow$ Sink
**What is Multiplexing?**
Multiplexing is a process of sending multiple streams of data via a single channel. It is implemented by using a multiplexer (MUX) on the source side and a de-multiplexer (DMUX) at the sink side.
Multiplexing can be done by various method such as time multiplexing and frequency multiplexing.
**What is the antenna size required to receive/transmit a signal?**
The antenna size needed to receive or transmit a signal is proportional to $\lambda/4$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the signal being transferred.
**What are the distortions caused by the channel?**
The channel causes various distortions such as Attenuation, Interference and Noise which are unavoidable but their effect on the signal can be minimized by proper modulation.
**What is spectrum allotment?**
Spectrum allotment is a restriction imposed by the government which confines usage of a limited band width for information transfer, hence ideal modulation methods should  
1. Minimize bandwidth of the signal to be able to fit more signals across a fix amount of bands
2. Minimize power of the signal to make the system more energy efficient
3. Maximize signal to noise ratio (SNR) to minimize effect of noise on the signal

**Types of Modulations**
Modulation can either be Analog (used in air traffic control and other essential industries) or Digital (used in most modern applications). 
Modulation can be done via two ways, Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM).
