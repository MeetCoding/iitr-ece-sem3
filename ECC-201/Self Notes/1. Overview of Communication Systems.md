Typical communication model:
Source $\rightarrow$ Transmitter Txr (Modulation) $\rightarrow$ Channel $\rightarrow$ Receiver Rxr (Demodulation) $\rightarrow$ Sink
**What is Multiplexing?**
Multiplexing is a process of sending multiple streams of data via a single channel. It is implemented by using a multiplexer (MUX) on the source side and a de-multiplexer (DMUX) at the sink side.
Multiplexing can be done by various method such as time multiplexing and frequency multiplexing.
**What is the antenna size required to receive/transmit a signal?**
The antenna size needed to receive or transmit a signal is proportional to $\lambda/4$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the signal being transferred.
**What are the distortions caused by the channel?**
The channel causes various distortions such as Attenuation, Interference and Noise which are unavoidable but their effect on the signal can be minimized by proper modulation.
**What is spectrum allotment?**
Spectrum allotment is a restriction imposed by the government which confines usage of a limited band width for information transfer, hence ideal modulation methods should  
1. Minimize bandwidth of the signal to be able to fit more signals across a fix amount of bands
2. Minimize power of the signal to make the system more energy efficient
3. Maximize signal to noise ratio (SNR) to minimize effect of noise on the signal

## What is Modulation? 
Imagine you want to send your voice or music over the radio to someone far away. The problem is, your voice is a low-frequency sound wave, and it can’t travel far or through the air very well on its own. So, what do we do?
**Modulation** is a clever trick engineers use to "ride" or "carry" your voice on a much faster radio wave called a **carrier wave**. This carrier wave is like a fast-moving wave that can travel long distances through space or cables.

### How Does Modulation Work?
You have two signals here:
- **Message signal (baseband):** This is your original information, like your voice or music.
- **Carrier signal:** This is a steady, high-frequency wave — think of it like a fast spinning wheel.
**Modulation** means changing some characteristic of the carrier wave (its height, speed, or position) based on your message signal, so when the carrier travels, it "contains" your message.

### Types of Modulation (Simple Examples)
- **Amplitude Modulation (AM):** The height (strength) of the carrier wave changes to match your message. Louder parts of speech make the wave bigger; quieter parts make it smaller.
- **Frequency Modulation (FM):** The speed (frequency) of the carrier wave changes depending on your message. When your voice is louder, the carrier wave wiggles faster or slower slightly.
- **Phase Modulation (PM):** The timing (phase) of the carrier wave shifts to carry your message.
These changes let the receiver figure out what your original voice was by "looking at" these changes in the carrier wave.

### Why Do We Use Modulation?
- **Travel Long Distances:** High-frequency waves travel far and can pass through the atmosphere or cables better.    
- **Multiple Signals Together:** Different stations can use different carrier frequencies so they don’t interfere with each other, just like radio channels.    
- **Make Efficient Use of Bandwidth:** By carefully choosing how to modulate, we use available frequencies efficiently.    
### How Modulation Helps in Real-Life
Imagine if everyone shouted at once in the same room (unmodulated signals). It would be chaotic! But if everyone chooses a unique "pitch" or frequency to talk on, then even if their voices mix, you can tune in to just the right frequency to hear the person you want (this is what happens with modulation and receivers).

## A Few More Ideas Made Simple
- **Hilbert Transform and Complex Envelope:** These are fancy math tools engineers use behind the scenes to make modulation easier to analyze and implement, especially for single-sideband (SSB) communications or digital systems.
- **Noise:** Just like static on a radio, noise is unwanted interference. Engineers have models to understand and minimize noise so your voice or data comes through clearly.
- **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop):** Think of it like a smart system that locks onto the carrier wave at the receiver, helping it "track" the signal perfectly, so it can correctly decode the message even if there’s noise or distortions.
- **Receiver Architectures (like Superheterodyne):** These are smart ways to build radio receivers that first bring the received signal down to a manageable frequency before decoding, which makes the whole process more reliable and flexible.
## Sampling and Quantization
When you send information using modulation (explained previously), the information may start as a real-world, continuously varying signal—like music or speech. However, in modern digital systems (computers, the internet, mobile phones), we need to turn this **analog** signal into something that can be processed, stored, or transmitted digitally. That’s where **sampling**, **quantization**, and **bitstreams** come in.
### Sampling
- **What is it?** Imagine you have a smooth, continuous wave (like a sound). **Sampling** is taking regular “snapshots” of the signal at very quick intervals, much like recording a video frame by frame.
- **Why?** This lets us capture how the signal changes over time using just a series of numbers, instead of a never-ending line.
### Quantization
- **What is it?** Each sample from sampling could, in theory, be any possible value. But computers need numbers they can handle (with a set number of digits or bits). **Quantization** “rounds” each sample to the nearest value from a limited set, kind of like choosing the closest color in a box of crayons.
- **Why?** This turns each sampled value into a number that can be represented using a fixed number of bits, making storage and transmission possible.    
### Bitstream
- **What is it?** Once we have all these quantized samples, we convert them to binary (0s and 1s). When we send or store the data, we send all these bits one after another—this series is called a **bitstream**.
- **Why?** Digital communication systems transmit bitstreams. The receiver reconstructs the original signal as closely as possible from the stream of 0s and 1s.    
### How it All Connects to Modulation
- **Analog Modulation:** Directly modulates your original, continuous signal onto a carrier.
- **Digital Modulation:** First converts the analog signal into a bitstream (via sampling and quantization), then modulates this bitstream onto a carrier (using schemes like PSK, FSK, QAM, etc.).
## What Is Bitrate?
- **Bitrate** is simply **how many bits (0s or 1s) are sent or received every second**.    
- Example: If you send a file at 1 megabit per second (1Mbps), that means 1,000,000 bits of information are being transmitted every second.    
### Factors Affecting Bitrate
- **Sampling Rate:** Sampling more times per second increases the number of samples (and thus bits) to send.    
- **Number of Quantization Levels (Bit Depth):** More bits per sample means higher detail, bigger file size, and a higher bitrate.
- **Compression:** Using smart algorithms, you can send the same information using fewer bits per second (lower bitrate) without losing as much quality.
- **Channel Bandwidth:** The physical “pipe” (like a wire or wireless frequency band) sets a maximum possible bitrate; you can’t send information faster than your channel can handle.
### Bitrate vs. Quality
- Higher bitrate usually means better quality (more information sent), but also requires more space and faster connections.
- Lower bitrate saves space and bandwidth but can lose details (music sounds “tinny,” video looks pixelated).
