FinFET is a non-planar, or "3D," transistor design introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional planar MOSFETs as device dimensions shrank to the nanometer scale.
- **Structure:**
    - Features thin, vertical silicon "fins" that rise above the substrate.
    - The gate wraps around the fin on three sides, allowing improved electrostatic control over the channel.
    - Multiple fins can be used side-by-side to adjust drive strength.
- **Advantages:**
    - Reduced short-channel effects and leakage currents.
    - Higher drive current and faster switching compared to planar MOSFETs.
    - Improved performance and energy efficiency, enabling further node scaling below 28nm.
- **Applications:**
    - Became the dominant technology for nodes at and below 14nm in CPUs, GPUs, and SoCs.

## GAAFET (Gate-All-Around FET)
Gate-All-Around FET is a further evolution of FinFET designed to enhance gate control at technology nodes below 5nm.
- **Structure:**
    - The gate completely surrounds the channel, which can be in the form of a nanowire or stacked nanosheets.
    - The most common GAAFET implementation uses horizontally stacked nanosheets or nanowires.
- **Key Features:**
    - Excellent electrostatic control, leading to suppression of short-channel effects and reduced leakage current.
    - Adjustable channel width by varying the number and width of nanosheets or wires.
    - Improved scalability and performance over FinFETs, suitable for sub-5nm nodes.
- **Benefits:**
    - Higher drive currents and lower power consumption.
    - Superior resistance to device variability.
    - Allows for further Moore’s Law scaling.

###  Nanosheet FET
Nanosheet FETs are a sub-type of GAAFET, where the channel is formed by horizontally stacked sheet-like structures.
- **Structure:**
    - Consists of planar, rectangular nanosheets instead of round nanowires.
    - Multiple nanosheets are vertically stacked, and the gate contacts all around each sheet.
- **Advantages:**
    - Wider and thicker channels compared to nanowire GAAFET, yielding higher drive current.
    - Tunable device width by adjusting the number and width of the nanosheets.
    - Enhanced electrostatic control similar to GAAFET, further reducing short-channel effects and leakage.
    - Allows for integration of various materials (e.g., SiGe) for improved mobility.
- **Applications:**
    - Future nodes at or below 3nm in high-performance computing.
    - Promising for fast-switching and low-power devices.

### RibbonFET
RibbonFET (pioneered by Intel) is Intel’s branded implementation of GAAFET using nanosheet architecture, marking a major step for post-FinFET scaling.
- **Structure:**
    - Utilizes several flattened, ribbon-shaped nanosheets (channels) that are each entirely surrounded by the gate.
    - The channel appears as a “ribbon,” maximizing surface area under gate control.
- **Innovation:**
    - Offers even greater electrostatic control than FinFETs, minimizing short-channel effects further.
    - Enables reduced device footprint and higher transistor density.
    - Delivers high drive current and efficiency via optimal channel width/height tuning.
- **Benefits:**
    - Consistently high performance with less susceptibility to process variations.
    - Scalable to advanced nodes (2nm and below).
    - Superior for applications requiring high density and low power—ideal for AI and advanced computing workloads.
