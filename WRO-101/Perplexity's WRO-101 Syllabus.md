## Exam Tips and Tricks

## Core Strategies

- **Master Basic Equations**: Power (P = ρgQHη), Load factor, Plant Capacity factor—ensure fluent and accurate application in solving any numerical.[8](https://www.scribd.com/document/137979505/Power)
    
- **Unit Consistency**: Always keep units consistent when calculating energy, power, or efficiency. Most errors are due to wrong units.
    
- **Table Reading**: Practice extracting and organizing data from tables for monthly and yearly calculations, as seen in tutorials.
    
- **Stepwise Solutions**: Always show intermediary steps for complex calculations; partial marks are often awarded for correct methodology.
    

## Advanced Tips

- **Relate Theory to Numerical Problems**: Many conceptual questions are just disguised numericals (e.g., "Why is a certain load shared as per the rating?").
    
- **Power Sharing Logic**: For droop and governor questions, memorize the formula for power sharing by droop percentage—draw block diagrams if helpful.
    
- **Graph Interpretation**: For load curves, shade and label areas for "base," "peak," and "shoulder" loads.
    
- **Time Management**: Allocate more time to calculation-heavy questions, but never skip definitions and conceptual short-answers—they boost total marks quickly.
    
- **Use Formula Sheet Smartly**: In open book exams, flag common formulae and solved examples in advance for quick reference.
