# Group

- **Theories of Formation:**
    - **Balance Theory of Group Formation:** The slide _names_ this theory. Its core idea is that we are motivated to keep our attitudes "balanced." We tend to like people who are similar to us. If you like a person, and that person likes a particular group, you will be motivated to like that group too, in order to "balance" your thoughts. We join groups with people who share our values and attitudes.
    - **Exchange Theory of Group formation:** The slide also _names_ this one. This is a cost-benefit theory. It suggests we join groups because we expect the "rewards" (like social support, security, status) to be greater than the "costs" (like time, effort, disagreements). We stay in a group as long as it is profitable for us.
- **Social Identity:**
    - **Exact Definition:** "The group acts as a source of identity," giving us a "Self-concept and self-knowledge," "Existential security," and a "Social network and support system."
    - **Related Terms:** The slide mentions this can be through **"Common-Bond Groups"** or **"Common-Identity Groups."**
        - **Common-Bond Groups:** These are groups formed based on the attachments _between members_ (e.g., a close group of friends, a family).
        - **Common-Identity Groups:** These are groups formed because members share a "common identity" or category (e.g., students from IIT Roorkee, fans of a sports team).
- **Self-Enhancement:**
    - **Exact Definition:** This is the "goal of increasing the positivity of one's self-image."
    - **How it Works:** A "Relation with strong and credible group boosts one's own public image." Our "Self-esteem gets tied to what- ever happens to the group."
- **Social Change:**
    - **Exact Definition:** Groups form to achieve "Social change," which in turn creates a "Politicized collective identity."
- **Ingroup & Outgroup:**
    - **Exact Definition:** This dynamic leads to "Ingroup favouritism," which is "When we see members of our group as better than other people, and people not in our group as all the same."

**What is a group?**
"Two or more individuals, interacting and interdependent, who have come together to achieve particular objectives."
- Members "Are motivated to join."
- They "Perceive the group as a unified unit of interacting people."
- They "Contribute in various amounts" and "Reach agreements and have disagreements through various forms of interaction."
- Can be a "Formal group" or "Informal group."

**Difference between Group and Team**
- **Work group:**
    - Members "Primarily share ideas and information."
    - They "Make decisions to help each group member perform within his or her area of responsibility."
    - They are "More-or-less independent."
- **Work Team:**
    - "A group whose performance is interdependent."
    - It is "Coherent and dependent" and "Formed with specific purpose."
    - Its "Output is greater (or less !!) than the sum of the individual inputs."
## Tuckman's Group Lifecycle

- **Forming:** This is the initial "getting to know you" stage. Group members are often polite, uncertain, and trying to understand the group's purpose, rules, and who everyone is. There is a high reliance on the leader for guidance.
- **Storming:** This is the conflict stage. As members get more comfortable, their personalities and opinions start to clash. There can be disagreements about the group's goals, leadership, or individual roles. This stage is often where the "pecking order" is established.
- **Norming:** In this stage, the conflict is resolved, and the group finds its harmony. Members agree on "norms" (acceptable standards of behavior), a clear structure emerges, and a sense of group identity and cohesion develops. They start to trust and help each other.
- **Performing:** This is the final, fully functional stage. The group's structure is set and accepted. The group's energy has moved from figuring itself out to focusing entirely on achieving its common goal or "performing" its task.
## Group Properties

### Group Property 1: Roles

A **"Role"** is "A set of expected behavior patterns attributed to someone occupying a given position in a social unit." This is the "part" you play, with examples like "CEO, Treasurer, Security guard, [or] Prime Minister."

Here are the key concepts that define your role:

- **Multiple roles:** This is a simple acknowledgment that we all occupy more than one role at a time (e.g., you can be a student, a child, and a team leader).
- **Role Perception:** This is "Our view of how we're supposed to act in a given situation." It's your personal, internal definition of your role.
- **Role expectations:** This is "The way others believe you should act in a given context." This is the _external_ definition of your role, coming from the group.
- **Role Assimilation:** This term is listed but not defined. It's the process by which you internalize your role to the point that it becomes part of your identity. You don't just "play" the role; your attitudes and actions start to genuinely align with it.
- **Role conflict:** This is the friction that occurs when expectations clash. The presentation lists several types:
    - **Multiple expectation conflict:** When different members of your group (or different groups) have competing expectations of you.
    - **Inter-role conflict:** When the expectations of two of your _different_ roles clash (e.g., your role as a student to study for an exam conflicts with your role as a friend to help someone in crisis).
    - **Perception - expectation conflict:** This is the one I missed. It's the conflict that arises when _your_ "role perception" (what you think you should do) clashes with the group's "role expectations" (what _they_ think you should do).
### Group Property 2: Norms

**"Norms"** are the "Acceptable standards of behavior within a group that are shared by the group's members." They are the unwritten rules that tell you "How to behave," "What to expect," and the "Limits of acceptance."

- **Feeling Rules:** Norms don't just guide actions; they also "shape the experience of emotions." These "Feeling Rules" are the "Expectations about the appropriate emotions to display or express" (e.g., "look professional on a video call," "be enthusiastic at a rally").
- **Individualism vs. Collectivism:** This concept is listed as it deeply affects a group's norms.
    - **Individualistic** cultures (common in the West) have norms that prioritize individual rights, personal achievement, and self-expression.
    - **Collectivistic** cultures (common in Asia and South America) have norms that prioritize group harmony, loyalty, and conformity to the group's goals.
- **Conformity:** This is the pressure to follow a group's norms. The presentation points to "Asch's conformity study" as the classic example, which showed people will often agree with a clearly wrong answer just to fit in.
- **Reference group:** This is any group you use as a standard for your own behavior. It refers to "Important groups to which individuals belong or hope to belong."

### Group Property 3: Status

**"Status"** is "A socially defined position or rank given to groups or group members." It's your "pecking order" or level of importance.

The presentation addresses "How do people acquire status?" using the **"Status characteristics theory"**. This theory states your status is derived from three sources:

1. "The power a person wields over others."
2. "A person's ability to contribute to a group's goals."
3. "An individual's personal characteristics."

The main effect of status is that the "Rules of the game change." High-status individuals are given more "Liberty to follow norms"—or even to break them without the same consequences as lower-status members.

### Group Property 4: Size and Dynamics

This property is primarily concerned with **"Social loafing"**.

- **Definition:** "The tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than when working individually." This is the "slacker" effect in a group project.
- **Causes:** This happens because of a "Diffusion of responsibility" (you feel less personally accountable) and "Acting in an exploitive manner" (you realize you can get away with doing less and still get the credit).
- **Prevention:** To "How to prevent social loafing," the presentation gives a clear list:
    - "Set group goals"
    - "Increase intergroup competition"
    - "Engage in peer evaluations"
    - "Select members who have high motivation and prefer to work in groups"
    - "Base group rewards in part on each member's unique contributions"

### Group Property 5: Cohesiveness

**"Cohesiveness"** is the glue of the group. It's "The degree to which members are attracted to each other and motivated to stay in the group."

- **Factors That Increase Group Cohesiveness:**
    - "Agreement on group goals"
    - "Frequency of interaction"
    - "Personal attractiveness"
    - "Intergroup competition"
    - "Favourable evaluation"
- **Factors That Decrease Group Cohesiveness:**
    - "Disagreement on goals"
    - "Large group size"
    - "Unpleasant experiences"
    - "Intragroup competition"
    - "Domination by one or more members"
- **A Warning:** "A highly cohesive group is analogous to a time bomb in the hands of management." This is because extreme cohesion can lead to _groupthink_, where no one dares to disagree.
- **Entitativity:** This is a related concept, defined as "The extent to which a group is perceived as being a coherent entity." A group has high entitativity when "Members interact... often," "The group is important... to its members," they "share common goals," and "perceive themselves as similar." For example, the presentation's table shows "Families" have very high entitativity, while "Region of country" is very low.

### Group Property 6: Diversity

**"Diversity"** is the "Degree to which members of the group are similar to, or different from, one another."

- **Types of Diversity:**
    - **Surface level diversity:** "Observable characteristics such as national origin, race, and gender."
    - **Deep level diversity:** "Underlying attitudes, values, and opinions."
- **Effects of Diversity:** Diversity has two main effects: it "appears to increase group conflict," but it is also "linked to creativity and performance."
- **Faultline:** This is a major risk of diversity. A "Faultline" is "Perceived divisions that split groups into two or more subgroups." These splits are "Based on individual differences such as sex, race, age, work experience, and education." For example, a faultline could form between the "older, experienced" members and the "new, younger" members, splitting the group in two.

## Group Dysfunction

1. **Social Loafing**
	- **Definition:** "The tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than when working individually."
	- **Causes:** "Diffusion of responsibility" and "Acting in an exploitive manner."
	- **Prevention:**
	    - "Set group goals"
	    - "Increase intergroup competition"
	    - "Engage in peer evaluations"
	    - "Select members who have high motivation"
	    - "Base group rewards in part on each member's unique contributions"
2. **Groupthink**
	- **Definition:** "A deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in group pressures" and "Pressures on individual members to conform and reach consensus."
	- **Symptoms:**
	    - "Those who oppose the group are stereotyped as evil, weak, or stupid."
	    - "Self-censorship of any deviation from the apparent group consensus."
	    - "Members... to discount warnings."
	    - "The group ignores questionable ethical or moral issues."
	    - "The illusion of invulnerability."
	    - "Illusion of unanimity - silence is interpreted as consent."
	    - "Self-appointed mindguards who protect the group from adverse information."

3. **Groupshift (Group Polarization)** 
	- **Definition:** The group "Gets polarised towards an extreme position." It's a "Special case of group-think."
	- **How it Happens:** "Members are more comfortable... willing to express extreme versions," "Group decisions are free of responsibility," and "People on the fringes take more extreme position."
	- **Risky Shift Phenomenon:** A specific example where "A group may make more risky decisions than the individual members would on their own."
## Power and Influence

Power refers to a capacity that A has to influence the behavior of B so B acts in accordance with A's wishes.

**Bases of Power**
This slide details the _sources_ from which power is derived:
- **Coercive Power:** "A power base that is dependent on fear of the negative results from failing to comply." (Power through punishment).
- **Reward Power:** "Compliance achieved based on the ability to distribute rewards that others view as valuable." (Power through giving rewards).
- **Legitimate Power:** "The power a person receives as a result of his or her position in the formal hierarchy of an organization." (Power from a formal title or position).
- **Expert Power:** "Influence based on special skills or knowledge." (Power from being an expert).
- **Referent Power:** "Influence based on identification with a person who has desirable resources or personal traits." (Power from being liked, respected, or admired).

**Dependence: The Key to Power**
- **Dependence:** "Probably the most important aspect of power is that it is a function of dependence."
- **The general Dependence Postulate:** "The greater B's dependence on A, the more power A has over B."
- **What Creates Dependence?** Your dependence on someone (and thus their power over you) increases based on three factors:
    1. **Importance:** The resource they control is important to you.
    2. **Scarcity:** The resource they control is rare.
    3. **Non-substitutability:** You have no other viable options or substitutes for that resource.
# Attribution

The process through which we seek to identify the causes of others’ behavior and so gain knowledge of their stable traits and **dispositions**.
- **Internal Attribution (Dispositional):** The cause is something about the person, rooted in their personality or traits.
- **External Attribution (Situational):** The cause is something about the situation or the environment.
$$Disposition = Behaviour - Situation$$
## Correspondent Inference Theory

A theory describing how we use others’ behavior as a basis for inferring their stable dispositions.
- **Behavior is Freely Chosen:** If someone _chooses_ to do something with no one forcing them, we strongly believe it reflects their true self.
- **Behavior is Low in Social Desirability:** When someone does something that goes against social norms or what's expected, we _really_ notice. Since they're not just "going with the flow," we assume their action is driven by a strong internal belief or trait. (e.g., If someone starts singing loudly in a quiet library, you don't think "the situation made them do it"; you think "is inconsiderate").
- **Behvaior has NonCommon Effects:** f someone chooses between two things that are almost identical, their choice doesn't tell us much. But if they pick an option with a very _unique_ feature, we assume that unique feature is what they wanted. (e.g., If someone chooses a job that pays less but is the _only_ one that lets them work outdoors, we infer they "value nature" or "hate being in an office").
## Covariation Theory

We judge a person's behavior by three criteria: 
- **Consensus:** The extent to which other people react to a given stimulus or event in the same manner as the person we are evaluating
- **Consistency:** The extent to which the person in question reacts to the stimulus or event in the same way on other occasions, over time
- **Distinctiveness:** The extent to which the person reacts in the same manner to other, different stimuli or events
By these criteria, we derive:
- **Internal Attribution:**  conditions in which consensus and distinctiveness are low, but consistency is high.
- **External Attribution:** consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness are all high.
## Casual Dimensions

- **Stable factors:** "Are the causal factors... likely to be stable over time, or... likely to change?"
    - "Personality traits and temperament - tend to be quite stable."
    - "motives, health, and fatigue can change over time."
- **Controllable factors:** "Can individuals change or influence them if they wish to do so."
    - "Individuals can, if they wish, learn to hold."
    - "Laws or social norms" are (uncontrollable).
## Biases and Errors

**Correspondent Bias (Fundamental Attribution Error)**
- **What it is:** This is the "tendency for people to over-emphasize dispositional or personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while under-emphasizing situational explanations". It's also known as the **Fundamental Attribution Error** or **Over-attribution effect**.
- **Example (from Jones & Harris, 1967):** Participants read essays about "Castro's rule in Cuba". Even when they were told that a writer was _instructed_ to write a pro-Castro essay (a "No Choice" situational constraint), they "did not correct their inference" and still assumed the essay reflected the writer's true beliefs.

**Actor-Observer Effect**
- **What it is:** This is the "Tendency to attribute our own behavior to situational (external) causes" "But the behavior of others to dispositional (internal) causes".
- **Example:** "When we see another person trip and fall, we tend to attribute it to his or her clumsiness" (internal). "If we trip, however, we are more likely to attribute our fall to situational causes" (external).

**Self-Serving Bias**
- **What it is:** This is the tendency to attribute our own positive outcomes to internal causes and our negative outcomes to external factors.
- **Example:** If your professor gives you an "A+" on a paper, you attribute this outstanding success to internal causes. If you get an "F grade," you attribute this negative outcome to external factors.

**Action Identification**
- **What it is:** This refers to how "Our interpretation of actions is different". We can interpret an act in "differing degrees of abstraction".
- **Example:** Seeing "Someone... putting change in jar".
    - **Low abstraction:** You view the action "concretely," as "little more than the actions themselves," and "make few attributions about their intentions".
    - **High abstraction:** The "Action has greater meaning". It "reflects much more the person's goals, characteristics, and intentions" (e.g., you identify it as "saving for the future").
