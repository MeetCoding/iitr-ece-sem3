**Definition:**  
Social cognition is the study of _how people perceive, interpret, analyze, remember, and use information about the social world_ and the behavior of others. Unlike general cognition, which includes thinking, perception, and learning in isolation, social cognition emphasizes cognitive processes in _social contexts_—how we understand and react to others in social interactions.

It involves mental processes including attention, memory, interpretation, reasoning, and decision-making as they relate specifically to social information and social environments.

**Real-life Examples:**

- Deciding whether someone’s smile is friendly or sarcastic.
    
- Recalling a teacher's traits when meeting a new instructor.
    
- Interpreting ambiguous behavior at a social event like a party or meeting.

## Core Concepts and Processes
### 1. **Schemas**

- **Definition:**  
    Schemas are cognitive frameworks or knowledge structures representing substantial information about concepts, their attributes, and relationships within social contexts. They help organize social information, guide attention, memory, interpretation, and influence behavior.
    
- **Conceptual Clarity:**  
    Schemas are "mental shortcuts" that simplify the complex social world by providing templates on how to process new social information. For example, a "teacher schema" includes traits like knowledgeable, authoritative, helpful, which aid quick judgment and expectations.
    
- **Influence on Social Thought:**
    
    - _Attention:_ Schemas determine what information we notice.
        
    - _Encoding:_ Information consistent with schemas is preferentially encoded. Inconsistent information may be encoded separately.
        
    - _Retrieval:_ People tend to recall schema-consistent information more readily than inconsistent.
        
- **Schema Persistence:**  
    Schemas exhibit strong perseverance—even when discredited. They shape future perceptions and memories, maintaining stability in social cognition.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - A stereotype about a profession influencing how you interpret individual actions.
        
    - Cultural schemas guiding expectations about social roles like "doctor" or "parent."

### 2. **Priming**

- **Definition:**  
    Priming is the activation of particular cognitive associations or schemas by external stimuli, often outside conscious awareness, which then influences perception, judgment, and behavior.
    
- **Examples and Classic Experiments:**
    
    - **Bargh et al. (1996):** Participants exposed to words related to old age walked slower afterward without awareness.
        
    - Psychological students reading about disorders become more attuned to noticing anxiety symptoms in themselves.
        
    - Watching a scary movie primes interpreting ambiguous noises as threats.
	    
	- **Experiment**: Ross and Samuels (1993) had dorm advisors nominate "cooperators" and "Defectors."
	    
		- **Manipulation**: Participants played a game called either the "Wall street game" or "Community game."
	    
		- **Result**: As shown in the bar graph, players in the "Community Game" were far more cooperative (~70%) than those in the "Wall Street Game" (~30%), regardless of whether they were labeled as "cooperators" or "defectors."
		
- **Priming in Daily Life:**  
    Hearing the word "cold" related to a person or environment can influence perception of social warmth or physical temperature.

### 3. **Scripts**

- **Definition:**  
    Scripts are specialized schemas representing knowledge about sequences of events or behaviors that occur in specific social contexts. They guide expectations and behavior in familiar situations.
    
- **Example:**  
    The "restaurant script" includes entering, ordering, eating, paying, which allows smooth navigation through social settings.

### 4. **Framing**

- **Definition:**  
    Framing refers to the way information or events are presented or structured, influencing decision-making and judgment by highlighting certain aspects while omitting others.
    
- **Tversky & Kahneman (1981) Asian Disease Experiment:**  
    Two groups given equivalent information but framed positively (lives saved) or negatively (deaths) showed different risk preferences:
    
    - Positive framing → Risk-averse choices
        
    - Negative framing → Risk-seeking choices
        
- **Applications:**  
    Political messaging, advertising, health communication use framing to influence attitudes and behaviors.

### 5. **Heuristics**

- **Definition (Kahneman & Tversky's heuristics theory):**  
    Heuristics are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that simplify decision-making under uncertainty, though sometimes leading to biases and errors.
    
- **Types:**
    

|Heuristic|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Representativeness|Judging based on similarity to a prototype|Assuming a quiet, bookish person is a librarian|
|Availability|Judging likelihood based on ease of recall|Overestimating shark attacks after media reports|
|Anchoring & Adjustment|Using an initial value as a reference and adjusting insufficiently|Estimating prices starting from GPS price quotes|

## Cognitive Biases

**Error in Judging:**
- **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking information consistent with one’s beliefs; rejecting opposing evidence. Example: Astrology believers ignoring disconfirming data.
    
- **Base Rate Fallacy:** Ignoring statistical base rates in favor of specific case details. Example: The startup investment example illustrates the base rate fallacy by showing how an investor might be swayed by a specific, compelling story—such as a charismatic founder and a revolutionary idea. This vivid presentation can cause them to ignore the general statistical fact, or "base rate," that the vast majority of new startups fail. Making an investment based on the impressive founder while disregarding the high probability of failure is a classic example of this cognitive error.
    
- **Gambler’s Fallacy:** Belief that outcomes "balance out" in short runs. Example: Believing a coin is "due" to land tails after multiple heads.
	
- **Hot Hand Fallacy:** the belief that a person who has experienced success has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts.

**Error in Self:**
- **False Consensus Effect:** Overestimating how much others share one's beliefs. Imagine you just watched a movie that you thought was absolutely brilliant. You assume that most other people must feel the same way. When you go online and see that many people disliked it, you're genuinely surprised.
    
- **Overconfidence Bias:** Excess confidence in one's judgments beyond actual accuracy. Example: Students overestimating test performance. Poor performers were more overconfident about predicting others' answers than better performers were; incompetence correlated with overconfidence. Reveals cognitive bias where low ability inflates confidence.
    
- **Optimistic Bias:** Underestimating personal risk of negative events. A driver might know that texting while driving is statistically very dangerous and leads to accidents. However, they believe they are a better-than-average driver and can handle it safely. They think that while accidents happen to _other_ people who text and drive, it won't happen to _them_. This underestimation of their personal risk is the **optimistic bias**.
    
- **Planning Fallacy:** t is the tendency to believe that we can accomplish more in a specific period than we actually can, or that a task will take less time than it really will.

**Errors Where Thoughts Feel Real:**
- **Counterfactual Thinking:** It refers to thinking about "what might have been." The slides note that upward counterfactuals (comparing outcomes to more favorable ones) can lead to strong feelings of dissatisfaction

- **Magical Thinking:** It involves making assumptions that don't hold up to rational scrutiny but feel compelling (e.g., refusing to eat a piece of chocolate shaped like a cockroach).

## System 1 and System 2

|Feature|System 1 (Intuitive)|System 2 (Deliberative)|
|---|---|---|
|Operation|Fast, automatic, effortless|Slow, controlled, effortful|
|Awareness|Mostly unconscious|Conscious|
|Function|Everyday, routine decisions|Complex, thoughtful decisions|
|Bias Vulnerability|High (heuristics, framing effects)|Lower, but slower|

- System 1 often dominates social cognition, allowing quick judgments but prone to biases.
    
- **Experiment**: Dijksterhuis and van Olden (2006) had students choose a poster to take home under three conditions: immediate decision, conscious thought, or unconscious thought (working on an anagram task as a distraction).
    - **Result**: 3-5 weeks later, the "unconscious thought" group reported the highest satisfaction with their choice (7.3/10) and valued their poster at the highest price (€9.56), significantly more than the "conscious thought" group (5.03 satisfaction, €6.68 price).
    - **Conclusion**: For complex decisions (like choosing between apartments with multiple variables), those who were distracted and unable to focus consciously made the most satisfying decisions.

## Embodied Cognition & Reasoning by Metaphor

- **Embodied Cognition:** Physical sensations influence social judgments. E.g., holding a warm drink increases perception of social warmth.
    
- **Reasoning by Metaphor:** Abstract social concepts are understood through concrete images/metaphors shaping interpretation (e.g., "relationship on the right track").

- **Landua, Sullivan and Greenberg Experiment:**
	- **Stage I**: Participants were primed with the concept of body contamination by reading about either harmful or non-harmful bacteria.
	    
	- **Stage II**: The United States was described using a body metaphor ("growth spurt") or without one ("period of innovation").
	    
	- **Result**: Those concerned about "body contamination" expressed more negative attitudes toward immigration when the body metaphor was used, compared to when it was not.
