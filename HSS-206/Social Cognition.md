## Introduction to Social Cognition

**Definition:**  
Social cognition is the study of _how people perceive, interpret, analyze, remember, and use information about the social world_ and the behavior of others. Unlike general cognition, which includes thinking, perception, and learning in isolation, social cognition emphasizes cognitive processes in _social contexts_—how we understand and react to others in social interactions.

It involves mental processes including attention, memory, interpretation, reasoning, and decision-making as they relate specifically to social information and social environments.
## Real-life Examples:

- Deciding whether someone’s smile is friendly or sarcastic.
    
- Recalling a teacher's traits when meeting a new instructor.
    
- Interpreting ambiguous behavior at a social event like a party or meeting.

## Core Concepts and Processes in Social Cognition

## 1. **Schemas**

- **Definition:**  
    Schemas are cognitive frameworks or knowledge structures representing substantial information about concepts, their attributes, and relationships within social contexts. They help organize social information, guide attention, memory, interpretation, and influence behavior.
    
- **Conceptual Clarity:**  
    Schemas are "mental shortcuts" that simplify the complex social world by providing templates on how to process new social information. For example, a "teacher schema" includes traits like knowledgeable, authoritative, helpful, which aid quick judgment and expectations.
    
- **Influence on Social Thought:**
    
    - _Attention:_ Schemas determine what information we notice.
        
    - _Encoding:_ Information consistent with schemas is preferentially encoded. Inconsistent information may be encoded separately.
        
    - _Retrieval:_ People tend to recall schema-consistent information more readily than inconsistent.
        
- **Schema Persistence:**  
    Schemas exhibit strong perseverance—even when discredited. They shape future perceptions and memories, maintaining stability in social cognition.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - A stereotype about a profession influencing how you interpret individual actions.
        
    - Cultural schemas guiding expectations about social roles like "doctor" or "parent."

## 2. **Priming**

- **Definition:**  
    Priming is the activation of particular cognitive associations or schemas by external stimuli, often outside conscious awareness, which then influences perception, judgment, and behavior.
    
- **Examples and Classic Experiments:**
    
    - **Bargh et al. (1996):** Participants exposed to words related to old age walked slower afterward without awareness.
        
    - Psychological students reading about disorders become more attuned to noticing anxiety symptoms in themselves.
        
    - Watching a scary movie primes interpreting ambiguous noises as threats.
        
- **Priming in Daily Life:**  
    Hearing the word "cold" related to a person or environment can influence perception of social warmth or physical temperature.

## 3. **Scripts**

- **Definition:**  
    Scripts are specialized schemas representing knowledge about sequences of events or behaviors that occur in specific social contexts. They guide expectations and behavior in familiar situations.
    
- **Example:**  
    The "restaurant script" includes entering, ordering, eating, paying, which allows smooth navigation through social settings.

## 4. **Framing**

- **Definition:**  
    Framing refers to the way information or events are presented or structured, influencing decision-making and judgment by highlighting certain aspects while omitting others.
    
- **Tversky & Kahneman (1981) Asian Disease Experiment:**  
    Two groups given equivalent information but framed positively (lives saved) or negatively (deaths) showed different risk preferences:
    
    - Positive framing → Risk-averse choices
        
    - Negative framing → Risk-seeking choices
        
- **Applications:**  
    Political messaging, advertising, health communication use framing to influence attitudes and behaviors.

## 5. **Heuristics**

- **Definition:**  
    Heuristics are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that simplify decision-making under uncertainty, though sometimes leading to biases and errors.
    
- **Types:**
    

|Heuristic|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Representativeness|Judging based on similarity to a prototype|Assuming a quiet, bookish person is a librarian|
|Availability|Judging likelihood based on ease of recall|Overestimating shark attacks after media reports|
|Anchoring & Adjustment|Using an initial value as a reference and adjusting insufficiently|Estimating prices starting from GPS price quotes|

## Classic Case Studies and Experiments

|Concept|Study/Experiment|Summary|Significance|
|---|---|---|---|
|Schema Persistence|Jacobson (1968) "Bloomers" Study|Teachers told some students would "bloom." Those students showed actual IQ gains—teacher's expectations influenced student performance (self-fulfilling prophecy).|Demonstrates powerful role of schemas on social behavior.|
|Priming|Bargh et al. (1996)|Primed participants with ageing-related words walked slower, unknowingly influenced by the prime.|Shows unconscious effects of priming on behavior.|
|Framing|Tversky & Kahneman (1981)|Asian disease problem: framing affected risk-taking choices, revealing biases in decision-making under uncertainty.|Introduced framing effect, foundational in behavioral economics.|
|Heuristics|Kahneman & Tversky's heuristics theory|Described availability, representativeness, and anchoring heuristics explaining cognitive shortcuts and biases in everyday judgments.|Key to understanding systematic decision biases.|
|Overconfidence|Dunning et al. (1990) Game Show Study|Poor performers were more overconfident about predicting others' answers than better performers were; incompetence correlated with overconfidence.|Reveals cognitive bias where low ability inflates confidence.|

## Cognitive Biases in Social Cognition

- **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking information consistent with one’s beliefs; rejecting opposing evidence. Example: Astrology believers ignoring disconfirming data.
    
- **Base Rate Fallacy:** Ignoring statistical base rates in favor of specific case details. Example: Judging which hospital has more rare birth outcomes incorrectly.
    
- **Gambler’s Fallacy:** Belief that outcomes "balance out" in short runs. Example: Believing a coin is "due" to land tails after multiple heads.
    
- **False Consensus Effect:** Overestimating how much others share one's beliefs.
    
- **Overconfidence Bias:** Excess confidence in one's judgments beyond actual accuracy. Example: Students overestimating test performance.
    
- **Optimistic Bias:** Underestimating personal risk of negative events.

## System 1 and System 2 Processing in Social Cognition

|Feature|System 1 (Intuitive)|System 2 (Deliberative)|
|---|---|---|
|Operation|Fast, automatic, effortless|Slow, controlled, effortful|
|Awareness|Mostly unconscious|Conscious|
|Function|Everyday, routine decisions|Complex, thoughtful decisions|
|Bias Vulnerability|High (heuristics, framing effects)|Lower, but slower|

- System 1 often dominates social cognition, allowing quick judgments but prone to biases.

## Embodied Cognition & Reasoning by Metaphor

- **Embodied Cognition:** Physical sensations influence social judgments. E.g., holding a warm drink increases perception of social warmth.
    
- **Reasoning by Metaphor:** Abstract social concepts are understood through concrete images/metaphors shaping interpretation (e.g., "relationship on the right track").
