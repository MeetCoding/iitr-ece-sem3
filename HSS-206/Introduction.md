## 1. Social Psychology

**Definition:**  
Social Psychology is the **scientific study of how people think, feel, and behave** in social contexts, i.e., when influenced by the **real, imagined, or implied presence of others**.

- **Psychology** ‚Üí study of mental processes and behavior.
    
- **Social Psychology** ‚Üí emphasis on **social interaction & influence** on individual behavior.
    

### 1.1 Core Features

|Value|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Objective**|Free of personal bias; relies on facts not opinions|
|**Systematic**|Uses structured methods (experiments, surveys)|
|**Generalizable**|Findings apply beyond sample studied|
|**Replicable**|Results should be repeatable|
|**Observable & Verifiable**|Open to empirical proof|
|**Falsifiable**|Hypotheses can be disproven|

### 1.2 Big Ideas in Social Psychology

1. We construct our **social reality** (perceptions shape reality).
    
2. Social **intuitions** are powerful but sometimes misleading.
    
3. **Social influences** shape our behavior.
    
4. **Personal attitudes & dispositions** matter.
    
5. Social behavior is **biologically rooted**.
    
6. Principles of social psychology are **applicable in everyday life**.
    

**Examples:**

- Why do people conform in groups? (Asch Experiment) -> The Asch conformity experiment demonstrated the power of group pressure. In the study, a single participant was placed in a group of actors and asked to perform a simple visual task. When the actors all gave an obviously wrong answer, a significant number of participants conformed to the incorrect majority, ignoring their own senses to avoid standing out.
    
- Why do individuals commit atrocities under authority? (Milgram Experiment) -> The Milgram experiment was a famous study on obedience to authority. Participants were instructed by an experimenter to deliver what they believed were increasingly painful electric shocks to another person (an actor). A shockingly high percentage of participants obeyed, administering the maximum voltage despite hearing the actor's screams of pain.

## 2. Perception

**Definition:**  
Perception = the **active selection, organization, and interpretation** of sensory input to construct an understanding of our surroundings.  
It‚Äôs not passive reception ‚Äì our brain actively reshapes signals into meaningful patterns.

- Reading jumbled words: _‚ÄúYuo cna raed tihs esaliy‚Äù_ ‚Üí brain organizes input despite errors.
	
- **Cocktail Party Phenomenon** ‚Üí selective attention to significant stimuli amid noise.  
    _Example:_ Recognizing your name across a crowded wedding hall.
    
- **Habituation** ‚Üí diminished response to repeated, unchanging stimuli.  
    _Example:_ Stop noticing the ticking of a wall clock.

### 2.1 Gestalt Principles

Gestalt Psychology principle ‚Üí _‚ÄúThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.‚Äù_

|Principle|Definition|Real-life Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Figure‚ÄìGround**|Distinguish central object (figure) from background|Gorilla-lion illusion with a tree|
|**Nearness**|Close stimuli grouped together|Words formed by spacing letters|
|**Similarity**|Similar elements grouped (color, size, shape)|Basketball team wearing same jersey|
|**Continuation (Continuity)**|Perception prefers smooth, continuous patterns|Seeing ‚àû as a loop instead of arcs|
|**Closure**|Brain completes incomplete figures|Seeing a circle even if parts are missing|
|**Contiguity**|Events close in time/space perceived as connected|Thunder after lightning|
|**Common Region**|Objects in a defined boundary seen as a group|Dots inside a drawn circle|

### 2.2 Perceptual Fallacies

**Illusion:** Misinterpretation of real external stimulus.

- _M√ºller‚ÄìLyer Illusion_ ‚Üí arrowhead lines cause size misjudgment.
    
- _Moon Illusion_ ‚Üí Moon looks larger at horizon.
    
- _Mirages_ in deserts.
    

**Delusion:** Strong false belief, resistant to logic and cultural norms.  
Types:

- **Erotomanic** (‚Äúcelebrity loves me‚Äù)
    
- **Grandiose** (overestimation of power/talent)
    
- **Jealous** (partner is cheating)
    
- **Persecutory** (spied or harmed by others)
    
- **Religious** (‚ÄúI am a God/The Messiah‚Äù)
    

**Hallucination:** Perception without external stimulus.

- Visual (seeing figures not present)
    
- Auditory (hearing voices)
    
- Olfactory (smelling odors that do not exist)
    

üí° **Mnemonic:**

- **Illusion** = Mis-seeing reality
    
- **Delusion** = False belief
    
- **Hallucination** = False perception

## 3. Motivation

**Definition:** Motivation is an **internal process** that initiates, directs, and sustains goal-directed behavior.

**Motivational Process (Flow Diagram):**

```
Need ‚Üí Drive/Tension ‚Üí Goal-directed Behavior ‚Üí Incentive/Reward ‚Üí Homeostasis
```

**Examples of Motivation in Social Context:**

- Dressing well for a party ‚Üí Social approval.
    
- Terrorist sacrifice ‚Üí Ideological motives.
    
- Model dieting ‚Üí Cultural pressures.
    
- Leaving a salary job for NGO ‚Üí Altruism/self-actualization.

### 3.1 Types of Motives

|Type|Meaning|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|**Primary (Biological)**|Innate, survival-based|Hunger, thirst, sleep, sex|
|**Secondary (Learned)**|Acquired via experience|Need for achievement, power, affiliation|
|**Stimulus Motives**|Desire for stimulation & curiosity|Exploration, play, novelty seeking|

---

### 3.2 Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

|Motivation|Source|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Intrinsic**|Internal satisfaction|Playing piano for joy|
|**Extrinsic**|External reward/punishment|Studying for grades or avoiding failure|

**Classic Study: Bruner‚Äôs Perceptual Experiment**

- Showed motives influence perception (hungry children more likely to see food-related images in ambiguous patterns). 
    ‚Üí Demonstrates **perception is shaped by needs**.

- While rich 10-year-olds showed some overestimation of coin sizes, poor 10-year-olds showed a much more pronounced deviation, overestimating the size of coins by as much as +50%. This highlights the direct impact of socioeconomic need on perception.

## 4. Research Methods

**Objective of Research:**

1. Describe reality precisely.
    
2. Test relationships (correlation).
    
3. Discover causal relations (experiments).
    
4. Develop/refine theory.

**Features of a Survey:** Accuracy, Objectivity, Skepticism, Open-mindedness, and Replicability

A **theory** is a set of coherent propositions that tries to explain a set of observations

### 4.1 Survey Method

- **Cross-sectional survey:** data at one point of time.
    
- **Longitudinal survey:** data across time.
    
- **Panel Study:** track the same group repeatedly.
    
- **Response Rate** critical for validity.
    

**Strengths:** Efficient, generalizable.  
**Weaknesses:** Biased reporting, low depth.

- **Random Sample**: In this method, every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. This is like drawing names out of a hat. It helps create a sample that is highly likely to be representative of the whole population.
    
- **Stratified Sample**: This method involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups, or "strata," based on shared characteristics (e.g., age, gender, major). Then, a random sample is taken from each of these subgroups. This ensures that all key groups within the population are represented in the final sample.

**Scales Used:**

- **Likert Scale:** Strongly Agree ‚Üî Strongly Disagree.
    
- **Semantic Differential:** Good ‚Üî Bad, Weak ‚Üî Strong.

### 4.2 Experimental Method

- **Independent Variable (IV):** manipulated factor.
    
- **Dependent Variable (DV):** measured effect.
	
- **Extraneous Variable:** affects the factor (in a study testing if caffeine improves memory, an extraneous variable could be the amount of sleep a participant got the night before)
    
- **Random Assignment:** ensures groups are equal.
    

**Types:**

1. **Laboratory Experiments** ‚Üí controlled setting.
    
    - Example: _Bystander Effect Study_ ‚Üí fewer people helped when more bystanders were present.
	    - **Independent Variable**: "The number of other persons who the participant believed were participating in the discussion".
		- **Dependent Variables**: "Whether the participant would leave the room to offer help" and "How quickly they would do so".

2. **Field Experiments** ‚Üí real-life setting.
    
    - Example: _Dutton & Aron Bridge Study (1974)_
        
        - More men from high-arousal suspension bridge called female experimenter (misattribution of arousal ‚Üí attraction).
        - **Independent Variable**: The arousal condition (High Arousal on a suspension bridge vs. Low Arousal on a solid bridge).
        - **Dependent Variable**: "The number of men who later called the experimenter".
