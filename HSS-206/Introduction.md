# 📘 SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY NOTES

**Topic:** Why do people behave the way they do?  
**Focus Areas:** Perception, Motivation, Emotions, Social Psychology as Science & Research Methods

---

## 1. Social Psychology: An Introduction

**Definition:**  
Social Psychology is the **scientific study of how people think, feel, and behave** in social contexts, i.e., when influenced by the **real, imagined, or implied presence of others**.

- **Psychology** → study of mental processes and behavior.
    
- **Social Psychology** → emphasis on **social interaction & influence** on individual behavior.
    

**Core Features of Science in Social Psychology**

|Value|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Objective**|Free of personal bias; relies on facts not opinions|
|**Systematic**|Uses structured methods (experiments, surveys)|
|**Generalizable**|Findings apply beyond sample studied|
|**Replicable**|Results should be repeatable|
|**Observable & Verifiable**|Open to empirical proof|
|**Falsifiable**|Hypotheses can be disproven|

**Big Ideas in Social Psychology (Classic Exam Question):**

1. We construct our **social reality** (perceptions shape reality).
    
2. Social **intuitions** are powerful but sometimes misleading.
    
3. **Social influences** shape our behavior.
    
4. **Personal attitudes & dispositions** matter.
    
5. Social behavior is **biologically rooted**.
    
6. Principles of social psychology are **applicable in everyday life**.
    

**Examples:**

- Why do people conform in groups? (Asch Experiment)
    
- Why do individuals commit atrocities under authority? (Milgram Experiment)

## 2. PERCEPTION

**Definition:**  
Perception = the **active selection, organization, and interpretation** of sensory input to construct an understanding of our surroundings.  
It’s not passive reception – our brain actively reshapes signals into meaningful patterns.

**Illustrations:**

- Reading jumbled words: _“Yuo cna raed tihs esaliy”_ → brain organizes input despite errors.
    
- Hearing your own name in a noisy party (Cocktail Party Effect).
    

---

## 2.1 Motives, Emotions, & Perception

- **Cocktail Party Phenomenon** → selective attention to significant stimuli amid noise.  
    _Example:_ Recognizing your name across a crowded wedding hall.
    
- **Habituation** → diminished response to repeated, unchanging stimuli.  
    _Example:_ Stop noticing the ticking of a wall clock.

## 2.2 Perceptual Organization: Gestalt Principles

Gestalt Psychology principle → _“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”_

|Principle|Definition|Real-life Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Figure–Ground**|Distinguish central object (figure) from background|Gorilla-lion illusion with a tree|
|**Nearness**|Close stimuli grouped together|Words formed by spacing letters|
|**Similarity**|Similar elements grouped (color, size, shape)|Basketball team wearing same jersey|
|**Continuation (Continuity)**|Perception prefers smooth, continuous patterns|Seeing ∞ as a loop instead of arcs|
|**Closure**|Brain completes incomplete figures|Seeing a circle even if parts are missing|
|**Contiguity**|Events close in time/space perceived as connected|Thunder after lightning|
|**Common Region**|Objects in a defined boundary seen as a group|Dots inside a drawn circle|

---

## 2.3 Perceptual Fallacies

**Illusion:** Misinterpretation of real external stimulus.

- _Müller–Lyer Illusion_ → arrowhead lines cause size misjudgment.
    
- _Moon Illusion_ → Moon looks larger at horizon.
    
- _Mirages_ in deserts.
    

**Delusion:** Strong false belief, resistant to logic and cultural norms.  
Types:

- **Erotomanic** (“celebrity loves me”)
    
- **Grandiose** (overestimation of power/talent)
    
- **Jealous** (partner is cheating)
    
- **Persecutory** (spied or harmed by others)
    
- **Religious** (“I am a God/The Messiah”)
    

**Hallucination:** Perception without external stimulus.

- Visual (seeing figures not present)
    
- Auditory (hearing voices)
    
- Olfactory (smelling odors that do not exist)
    

💡 **Mnemonic:**

- **Illusion** = Mis-seeing reality
    
- **Delusion** = False belief
    
- **Hallucination** = False perception

## 3. MOTIVATION

**Definition:** Motivation is an **internal process** that initiates, directs, and sustains goal-directed behavior.

**Motivational Process (Flow Diagram):**

text

`Need → Drive/Tension → Goal-directed Behavior → Incentive/Reward → Homeostasis`

**Examples of Motivation in Social Context:**

- Dressing well for a party → Social approval.
    
- Terrorist sacrifice → Ideological motives.
    
- Model dieting → Cultural pressures.
    
- Leaving a salary job for NGO → Altruism/self-actualization.
    

---

## 3.1 Types of Motives

|Type|Meaning|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|**Primary (Biological)**|Innate, survival-based|Hunger, thirst, sleep, sex|
|**Secondary (Learned)**|Acquired via experience|Need for achievement, power, affiliation|
|**Stimulus Motives**|Desire for stimulation & curiosity|Exploration, play, novelty seeking|

---

## 3.2 Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

|Motivation|Source|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Intrinsic**|Internal satisfaction|Playing piano for joy|
|**Extrinsic**|External reward/punishment|Studying for grades or avoiding failure|

**Classic Study: Bruner’s Perceptual Experiment**

- Showed motives influence perception (hungry children more likely to see food-related images in ambiguous patterns).  
    → Demonstrates **perception is shaped by needs**.

## 4. RESEARCH METHODS IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY

**Objective of Research:**

1. Describe reality precisely.
    
2. Test relationships (correlation).
    
3. Discover causal relations (experiments).
    
4. Develop/refine theory.
    

---

## 4.1 Survey Method

- **Cross-sectional survey:** data at one point of time.
    
- **Longitudinal survey:** data across time.
    
- **Panel Study:** track the same group repeatedly.
    
- **Response Rate** critical for validity.
    

**Strengths:** Efficient, generalizable.  
**Weaknesses:** Biased reporting, low depth.

**Scales Used:**

- **Likert Scale:** Strongly Agree ↔ Strongly Disagree.
    
- **Semantic Differential:** Good ↔ Bad, Weak ↔ Strong.
    

---

## 4.2 Experimental Method

- **Independent Variable (IV):** manipulated factor.
    
- **Dependent Variable (DV):** measured effect.
    
- **Random Assignment:** ensures groups are equal.
    

**Types:**

1. **Laboratory Experiments** → controlled setting.
    
    - Example: _Bystander Effect Study_ → fewer people helped when more bystanders were present.
        
2. **Field Experiments** → real-life setting.
    
    - Example: _Dutton & Aron Bridge Study (1974)_
        
        - More men from high-arousal suspension bridge called female experimenter (misattribution of arousal → attraction).
            

---

## 4.3 Other Methods

- **Naturalistic Observation:** Jane Goodall studying chimpanzees.
    
- **Case Study:** Phineas Gage → brain injury changed personality → link between frontal lobe & emotions.

## 6. END NOTES (Memory Aids for Exams)

- **I–D–H Rule** for perceptual fallacies:
    
    - Illusion = Incorrect perception
        
    - Delusion = Distorted belief
        
    - Hallucination = Imagined perception
        
- **Gestalt Mnemonic:**
    
    - **N.S.C.C.C.C.** → Nearness, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, Contiguity, Common Region
        
- **Motivation Cycle (ASCII):**
    
    text
    
    `Need → Drive → Behavior → Incentive → Goal Fulfillment → Reduced Need`
